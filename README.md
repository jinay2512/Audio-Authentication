# Audio-Authentication

In this project, a sound signature system with a supportive to graphical password increase the remembrance of the password is discussed. In proposed work a user is asked to select a sound signature corresponding to click point this sound signature will be used to help the user to login. System will show very good Performance in terms of speed, accuracy, and ease of use in addition click-based graphical password scheme called Cued Click Points (CCP) is presented. In this system a password consists of sequence of some images in which user can select one click-point per image. Users preferred CCP to Pass Points, saying that selecting and remembering sound signature helps considerably in recalling the click point. In order to store passwords in cryptographically hashed form, we need to prevent small uncertainties in the click points from having any effect on the password. We achieve this by introducing a robust discrimination, based on multi grid discrimination.
